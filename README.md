Using PayPal API as Payment Option

PayPal is one of the most popular payment options often used for E-commerce sites. I made this projects/repo to improve and showcase my skills with customizing/implementing third party APIs.

What it does:

This app gets the information from users(Item Name and Item Price). After getting the required information, it will send all the information entered by the user to PayPal. All the payment processes will be handled by PayPal. After the transaction is complete, the app will inform the user that the transaction is successful.


How to use:

For testing purposes, I placed 4 input boxes. 2 for the "Item Name" and 2 for the "Item Price". The user SHOULD fill up all the input boxes. After filling up all the input boxes, press the button "DONE". Then the PayPal button will appear. Press the PayPal button then enter PayPal account information. 

For testing/development purposes, contact me (ragelavigne@gmail.com) so I can send you a PayPal Sandbox Account that could be used for testing and development purposes only.
